Data Set Characteristics:  Multivariate, Time-Series

Number of Attributes: 175

This big data set is a fused bi-temporal optical-radar data for cropland classification. 
The images were collected by RapidEye satellites (optical) and the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) system (Radar) over an agricultural region near Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada on 2012.
There are 2 * 49 radar features and 2 * 38 optical features for two dates: 05 and 14 July 2012.


Seven crop type classes exist for this data set as follows: 1-Corn; 2-Peas; 3- Canola; 4-Soybeans; 5- Oats; 6- Wheat; and 7-Broadleaf.
